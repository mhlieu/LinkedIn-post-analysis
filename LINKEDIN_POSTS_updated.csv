✨TAKE HOME ASSIGNMENTS✨

Better than projects, courses, certifications or even on-the-job training in my opinion 😱

Most people find them annoying (and some lunatics even prefer live-coding during interviews) but I think take-homes given to you during an interview process force you to learn a lot, very quickly 📈

The questions asked and data provided are deliberately vague and messy to mimic the work you’d actually do on the job, so you’re forced to get your hands dirty in a way that structured courses don’t allow you to do 🔢

But you also have the added pressure of a deadline, which means you can’t spin your wheels for too long like you would on a longer-term project you do for a company or for yourself ⏱

Lastly, unlike live-coding interviews, you usually can use any resource to look up syntax and concepts, and we all know learning how to code comes from Googling/StackOverflow 🙌 

Do you prefer take-home assignments or live-coding interviews? 🤔

NONE. 

I get asked this question pretty often—while I think any online course is great for learning the basics, I truly believe hands-on project experience will always be superior in getting you that data role at the end of the day. 

Sure, I have the Google Data Analytics certificate and some LinkedIn badges, but do I think they were very useful at signaling my value as a potential hire? NOPE. (In fact, I actually completed the Google cert AFTER I got hired) 🙅🏻‍♀️

What DID get me hired was one fateful #PowerBI project I did while still working as a financial analyst, and being able to speak about the QUANTIFIABLE IMPACT of that project by communicating it in STAR format 🌟

But if you haven’t been able to do actual data analytics projects in your current role, this is what I recommend instead of reaching for the popular data certification everyone posts about on LinkedIn:

👉 Work with data/tools you already have at your company (e.g. I used good ol’ Excel to analyze financial data at my old job)
👉 Find projects on Kaggle (e.g. I started with the trusty Titanic dataset)
👉 Analyze personal data (e.g. I visualized powerlifting competition stats)
👉 Research a topic you’re interested in (e.g. I scraped and analyzed Zillow home price data)

Then, shoutout your DIY data project here on LinkedIn, GitHub or Tableau Public, and voila, a much better way of showing off that you can not only learn, but do as well 👏

This is not a post knocking R at all, it is one knocking my own coding abilities. I post plenty about Python and SQL, but never about R because honestly, I stink at it. 

I’ve been working on a project where all of the analyses are done in R, and all the team members are R-pro’s except me. This engagement was expected to be a fast turnaround, but it was slowed down because of me. There were so many times when I was completely stumped by the simplest ask because I just didn’t know how to code it 

I’d spend so long just looking up the documentation to even know where to begin, and would feel like such a burden for every one of the stupid questions I’d ask my Director, or even the Associates “under” me–“I’m not sure why this isn’t working…”

And in all of those moments, I felt like the team’s crutch, an imposter, a complete failure, you name it.

BUT, a year ago, I felt the same exact way about picking up Python and SQL. Overcoming those feelings didn’t take a week or even a month–heck I still feel that way at least once a week now. I never stopped back then, and I sure as heck am not stopping now.

Post inspired by Alex Nguyen’s latest one about failure, so give him a follow if you’ve enjoyed posts like mine!

(Seriously LinkedIn algorithm, please answer for yourself because I really need to know how)

At the end of 2021, I had one 🚀 post that made me actually want to give this “consistent posting” thing a try (or as some people liked to poke fun as “LinkedIn influencing”, “selling out”, etc.).

Since then, I’ve been sharing posts about my journey into data–both its ups and its downs–because that’s just the content I love seeing on my own feed.

I’ve had some posts perform really well, others really badly, and then one that somehow ended up getting more impressions than all of my previous posts COMBINED (still in shock 😭)

But while it’s really cool watching the vanity metrics go up 📈 there has to be something that keeps you going when you post, only get <20 pity likes and a bruised ego 📉 (my deepest thanks to the pity-likers, they are the real ones).

For me, I’ve realized that thing that keeps me going is meeting like-minded folks who are as passionate about this field as I am, and building genuine relationships with them.

To all the people who have supported me through my more “popular” posts, but have also tolerated me through my lamer ones, thank you 🙏

Said recruiter never sent me emails during regular business hours—he probably only ever emailed me once before 10 PM. He also FORGOT to schedule my final round interviews and didn’t do so until the hiring manager stepped in. But I brushed aside every single warning sign because I was so excited and grateful for the opportunity

A week after a final round interview with the company, the recruiter emailed me saying “I had the chance to catch up with the team and I have an update for you! Are you free to chat between 5-6 PM tomorrow? I hope to hear from you soon!” (exact words and punctuation)

The day of, he confirmed he’ll give me a call. Buzzing with excitement based on the language and how eager he was to catch me, I eagerly waited by my phone at the suggested time with my heart pounding…

Only to be ghosted and receive no response to any follow-up emails until 11 pm that night. Apologetic, he asked to reschedule and I proposed to meet at the same time the next day.

No response to my suggested time all day until the time comes and goes, so I sent yet another follow-up email. He finally responds, saying he’ll call me in an hour. 

Again, I assumed based on his eagerness to talk with me over the phone that it’s an offer–he could just send me an email, or even ghost me, if it was a no, right?

Two and a half hours passed, I finally received his call and felt like I could breathe for the first time in 3 days

“The team absolutely loved your presentation, but unfortunately…”

Shocked and confused as to why this wasn’t an email (even just an auto-generated one!) instead of stringing me along for 3 days, I vowed to never be that presumptuous again when it comes to something as unpredictable as the job search. Never assume you have an offer until you have it in writing.

But I also vowed to never ignore red flags in an interview process again. I had written off all of my previous apprehensions as “people get busy” when I should have seen the warning signs as a lack of consideration for candidates’ time.

First and foremost ✨PROJECT EXPERIENCE✨

I had done just one somewhat relevant project before using Power BI in my previous role, so best believe I milked it. Namely, I used the STAR format and specifically communicated the BUSINESS IMPACT it achieved, and highlighted the specific process and tools used to accomplish it.


Second: ✨NETWORKING✨

I connected with someone from the team I was targeting, and fostered a genuine relationship with him with 0 expectations of any referral. I spent so much time talking to folks in the industry just learning about what even is a role in data analytics, and along the way received a few referrals that happened to pan out. 


Lastly, demonstrating ✨TRANSFERABLE SKILLS✨

Even if you don’t have the specific technical skills recommended, chances are you can pick out at least a few transferable ones that can bridge the gap to the skills the role is looking for. I highlighted the quantitative and storytelling skills I used in my role as a financial analyst in my interviews, and spun them to apply to the the context of this role.


Bonus factor: a little bit of ✨LUCK✨

Part of me still thinks I got here by just being in the right place at the right time. So for those who are still trying to make the transition and doing all of the above, keep at it because your one yes WILL come 💯

(Because Excel deserves some love too 🥰)

When you need to autofill a blank column in a spreadsheet that has tens, hundreds or thousands of rows 👇🏼

1️⃣ Go to the first filled cell in your column with the value or formula you want to drag down
2️⃣ Toggle left or right to the next column over that is fully populated
3️⃣ Ctrl +  down to get to the bottom of that filled column
4️⃣ Toggle back to the empty column to get to the last (blank) row/cell of it
5️⃣ Leave any character in that last cell as a marker for where your autofill should stop
6️⃣ Ctrl + up to get back up to the last filled cell in this column
7️⃣ Ctrl + shift + down to highlight all cells down to your marker
8️⃣ Ctrl + D to autofill down to your marker (no more filling too far!)

If you find dragging down or even double clicking with your mouse too cumbersome, or if you’re someone like me who feels very strongly about not using your mouse when using Excel (shout out old EY coworkers for instilling this in me), give this a try 💡

The first time I used window/analytical functions, I thought “I might have underestimated SQL” 😬

The first time I ran a cursor, used a stored procedure, executed a transaction, optimized a query using indexes, learned data modeling concepts, etc. I thought “I actually know very little about SQL” 😖

The first time I realized I’d been learning just one dialect of SQL and that there are many more out there to know, I realized I know nothing at all, and that’s ok 😌

Kaggle’s housing price datasets were my starting point, but I soon realized I wanted this to actually be applicable and useful for my personal life–namely, I wanted to be able to use this for my own home search. Since none of the datasets in Kaggle had prices for homes in the Northern Virginia area, I scraped my own data from Zillow listings and then got to work.

The goal of this project was to use Python throughout the course of this entire project, making this the first one where I’ve used Python end-to-end: loading, cleaning, transforming, visualizing and building of 6 different regression models. It made for some long nights of Stack Overflow and debugging code that was breaking because of syntax errors, but it was all worth it.

Most important takeaways (besides the fact that the DMV is very very expensive):

💡 The median home price for homes of at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in Northern Virginia was $1.01m (!)
💡 Great Falls, Vienna and Arlington had the highest median home prices while Centreville, Reston and Sterling had the lowest median prices
💡 Great Falls, Vienna and Arlington had the highest median home sizes by square foot while Centreville, Reston and Sterling had the lowest median sizes
💡 Buyers pay the most per sqft for homes in Arlington, McLean and Vienna, while Manassas, Annandale and Ashburn had the “best bang for your buck” in terms of price/sqft
💡 Using an Elastic Net Regression model, a home’s price is expected to increase by $226.60 for each additional square foot, by $65.7k for each additional bathroom, by $29.3k for each additional bedroom, and by $4.60 for each dollar increase in the median income of the city where the home is located.

And that’s a wrap on the first episode of ML Learns ML! Please visit the link found in the comments below to see the full project and write-up in my Github. Thank you in advance for any and all feedback 🙏

Update: At the end of this project, I signed on my first home 🥳

With my last post about late-night coding, I received so many supportive responses saying how they can relate, how it’s actually a sign of passion, and tips for much-needed mental resets.

But the above advice, while probably well-meaning, was the comment that stuck with me the most. 

Honestly probably not the best advice to give someone who was once non-technical but has now made a career switch into a technical field she absolutely loves.

I get it though—I told myself the same thing back when I thought the field I went to school for was the one I'd stay in forever, thought I’d never code (or do anything STEM-related) because I “just didn’t get it,” and overall never bothered trying hard things.

But these days, I’m so glad I bothered—and so glad I never followed any advice (not even my own) to “stay in my lane.”

Steer into unknowns and cross all the lanes, even when you or anyone else thinks you can’t.

1. Oh how I've missed math and how I can just sit down for hours on end, scratching away on a physical piece of paper, crunching numbers until I've found the right answer or solved the puzzle. But I cannot say the same about timed, graded exams…
 
2. I’ve always found math fun, but also always thought I’d never see high-level math in the real world. But beyond engineering, apparently Linear Algebra has so many applications in economics, chemistry, and physical network flows as seen in circuit design and transportation systems!
 
3. Although I was good at high school math classes, I never went beyond Calculus 1 because I used to be so afraid of challenges and potentially not being good anymore at the “next level,” especially when it came to highly technical and STEM-related courses (fixed mindset AF). 2021 has been the year where I picked up coding AND a real college-level math class–all of which I never ever thought I’d do had you asked me just last year–thus proving to myself once and for all that I can indeed accomplish hard things that push me beyond my comfort zone (finally catching onto this growth mindset thing).
 
4. The greatest irony/tragedy is that I never appreciated learning when I was a full-time student (aka when my only real responsibility was to learn). I remember being so excited to graduate because I thought it meant I’d be done with learning. And now, when I have so many other real-world responsibilities on my plate, I look forward to any opportunity to be a student again (the grass apparently isn’t greener on the other side!) Which leads me to…
 
5. The best kind of learning is the continuous kind. Whether it’s done in a structured, classroom setting, through reading in my free time or a MOOC–learning and being a knowledge-soaking student again has given me such a renewed sense of purpose because there’s never a finish line. The more you do it, the more “next levels” you unlock. And at each level, I was right that you may not be very good when you first start out. But maybe, just maybe, being a beginner, being challenged and doing hard things are the best (Christmas) gifts we can give to ourselves! 
 
Next up…Calculus 2! When I’m pulling my hair out with differential equations and parametric equations, I’ll be sure to refer back to my own takeaways above 🙏🏻

PS: Read Mindset by Carol Dweck. Life changing stuff.

I wanted to take this opportunity to reintroduce myself to all the new (and old) connections here on LinkedIn 👋

My name is Megan and I'm a lover of all things data! I consider myself extremely lucky to be able to work with data on a daily basis as a current Senior Associate doing Analytics & Data Strategy, but I didn't always know ""what I wanted to be when I grow up.""

After graduating from the University of Virginia studying Business and Finance (because that's what all my friends were studying), I spent the first two years post-grad in denial that being an adult was for the rest of my life. Those first two years were filled with a lot of countdowns to Fridays, Sunday Scaries, and an overall passionless existence. For some reason, I thought this arrangement was temporary--that one day I'd be hit with a wave of inspiration and ""adulting"" would just click.

Things had to get a lot worse before I realized that life doesn't just click on its own--you have to put yourself out there, try new and challenging things, and not be afraid of rejection/failure to reach that aha! moment(s). And for me, that moment came in the form one fateful project using Power BI, which led to countless online courses, then dozens of interviews, and eventually to where I am today.

When I discovered my love for data, I discovered along with it the stories it can tell, the problems it can solve, and the people it can connect. But I also found something new in me through data--a side of me that never wanted to stop learning, and always wanted to tackle obstacles head on, rather than shy away from challenges like I always had before.

I started waking up earlier, reading for pleasure, volunteering to take on more responsibilities than just what was required of me at work, and even signed up for Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calc courses at my local community college (!)--all of these things would be unrecognizable to the old, complacent me from just a few months prior.

So in a way, this picture is more than just a new headshot; it symbolizes a new Megan 🙏

Moral of the story: If you're a new grad/adult and feeling lost, rest assured it gets so much better.

I never would have imagined being excited to come back to an office at the beginning of this pandemic (I'm a major homebody), but these days I really cherish the opportunities I get to meet face-to-face with my new coworkers.

As someone who was in the last graduate class to have started in a non-remote environment, I spent 7 months taking for granted human interactions and relationships in the workplace before offices shut down.

Then during the pandemic, there were so many times when I'd feel so alone--spinning my wheels on problems I didn't want to ping my coworkers about out of fear of being annoying, not being able to destress with teammates during lunch breaks, etc.

So when I started remote at Ankura, I made it a goal to take advantage of as many opportunities to meet new people as possible, even when it scared me (I'm also a major introvert).

But every time I did, I never regretted it. Building and maintaining authentic relationships is always worth it, and it took a pandemic for me to finally realize that.

Those who know me outside of work know powerlifting is passion of mine. I am a competitor and Virginia State referee (soon to be National referee), and love giving back to the sport in my free time.

The following dashboards show stats from the Virginia State Championships this past May, where I served as a referee judging the 200 competitors who each competed in the squat, bench and deadlift events across the 2-day meet.

Having witnessed the event's action in person at the time, I then wanted to take a step back to analyze the overall meet data to examine the following using Tableau:
💡 Competitor pool profile, broken out by age, weight classes, equipment used, gender and the states they represented
💡 Results of the event, on an individual and weight-class-averaged basis, measured in Goodlift Points (which measures an individual's strength, normalized for his/her bodyweight, gender and whether the individual lifted raw or equipped) 
💡 Results of the event again, but measured in DOTS (a different measure commonly used, but only normalizes for his/her bodyweight and gender)
💡 Individual attempts by all competitors across all 3 lifts, showing which attempts were good lift (e.g. successful attempt) or no lift (e.g. failed attempt)

I had actually started this project using Power BI but ran into limitations when I was trying to visualize the Attempts dashboard using independent line graphs for each data point across a categorical x-axis (e.g. attempts 1, 2 and 3 for each lift). But that made for a great learning process in both visualization tools!

Overall, this was such a fun way to apply what I've learned in my data analytics journey so far to a passion project of mine. Please check out the dashboards in detail in the link below, and feel free to provide any feedback for improvements to them!

I was so grateful for the chance to share what I’d learned from the data analytics job search process I had just gone through.

I had learned so much about job applications, resumes, pivoting to a new field, learning new technical skills and networking during a tough job search, and I was dying to share my experiences with anyone who could get any value out of them.

But while I was excited, I also truthfully felt so much imposter syndrome. My fellow panelists were CDO’s, VP’s, founders, senior directors and managers, you name it, all with at least a decade or two more experience in the field than I have. Who was I, at 3 weeks into my first ever analytics job, to give advice about the field?

To calm myself down from the nerves, I treated the event as a learning experience. In many of the conversations, I was another one of the attendees in the audience, soaking in all the wisdom these titans of the industry had to share.

Despite the imposter-syndrome-induced hesitations and public speaking fears, I would not have traded this experience for anything. Not only did I get to give back to the institution, UVA McIntire School of Commerce, that started all of this for me in the first place, I met movers and shakers in the field, and also discovered how rewarding it was to be able to act as a resource to those whose shoes I was in just a few months ago.

A big thank you to Amanda Morris, PMP, Trey Maxham, Sarah Rogis and Lanfei Shi for putting on this amazing event, and considering little old me to be part of it this year.

While I was fortunate enough to start my first position in analytics at Ankura prior to completing the certificate (and have already begun to apply the concepts just 3 weeks in!), I know my learnings from the past few months have prepared me for an exciting rest of my career to come.
